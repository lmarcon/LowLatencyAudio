LowLatencyAudio
=================

LowLatencyAudio is a native plugin for PhoneGap.  This implementation is designed to be compatible with PhoneGap 3.0 CLI deployment, and supports both iOS and Android.

## Installation

The LowLatencyAudio plugin can be added to your project via the PhoneGap command line tools.  Simply use the following command to add this to your project:

`cordova plugin add https://github.com/CloudKidStudio/LowLatencyAudio`

You will also need to include the AudioToolbox library in your XCode project. Instructions for linking frameworks can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-project_editor/Articles/AddingaLibrarytoaTarget.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010155-CH17-SW1).

## Usage

1. Preload the audio asset - Note: Make sure to wait for phonegap deviceready event before atteptimpting to load assets
2. Play the audio asset
3. When done, unload the audio asset

## API methods
	preloadFX: function ( id, assetPath, success, fail)
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				assetPath - the relative path to the audio asset within the www directory
				success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				The preloadFX function loads an audio file into memory.  Assets that are loaded using preloadFX are managed/played using AudioServices methods from the AudioToolbox framework.   These are very low-level audio methods and have minimal overhead.  Audio loaded using this function is played using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound.   These assets should be short, and are not intended to be looped or stopped.   They are fully concurrent and polyphonic.
			
	preloadAudio: function ( id, assetPath, voices, success, fail) 
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				assetPath - the relative path to the audio asset within the www directory
				voices - the number of polyphonic voices available
				success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				The preloadAudio function loads an audio file into memory.  Assets that are loaded using preloadAudio are managed/played using AVAudioPlayer.   These have more overhead than assets laoded via preloadFX, and can be looped/stopped.   By default, there is a single "voice" - only one instance that will be stopped & restarted when you hit play.  If there are multiple voices (number greater than 0), it will cycle through voices to play overlapping audio.
		
	play: function (id, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				success - success callback function - takes an integer (index of audio that has been played)
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Plays an audio asset - the index is only passed to success with assets loaded via preloadAudio
		
	loop: function (id, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				success - success callback function - takes an integer (index of audio that has been played)
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Loops an audio asset infinitely - this only works for assets loaded via preloadAudio
		
	stop: function (id, index, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				index - index of a specific audio voice to stop - pass -1 or null to stop all voices for the audio file.
				success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Stops an audio file - this only works for assets loaded via preloadAudio
		
	unload: function (id, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Unloads an audio file from memory

	pause: function (id, index, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				index - index of a specific audio voice to pause - pass -1 or null to pause all voices for the audio file.
				success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Pauses an audio file - this only works for assets loaded via preloadAudio

	setVolume: function (id, volume, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				volume - The volume between 0 and 1, inclusive, to set the audio to.
				success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Sets the volume for an audio file - this only works for assets loaded via preloadAudio

	getDuration: function (id, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				success - success callback function - takes an integer that is the duration in milliseconds
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Gets the duration of an audio file - this only works for assets loaded via preloadAudio

	getPosition: function (id, index, success, fail) 	
		params: ID - string unique ID for the audio file
				index - index of a specific audio voice to check
				success - success callback function - takes an integer that is the position in milliseconds. For audio that is not paused or playing, -1 is passed.
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:	
				Gets the position of an audio voice - this only works for assets loaded via preloadAudio

	getCapabilities: function (success, fail)
		params: success - success callback function
				fail - error/fail callback function
		detail:
				Gets an object describing capabilities of the device as expected by SoundJS.
